# game_of_life
# Hello everybody. This is a simple interactive example of a 'game of life'.
# My program uses PYGAME for visualization, NUMPY for arrays and NUMBA to make my program faster - so you
# need to install them before run the program.
# Please send me your wishes and report bugs if you find them.
